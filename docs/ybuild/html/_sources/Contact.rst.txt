The AdaptiveMasterMSM package is open-source, and thus we appreciate any contribution to the code, such as

    Ideas of missing features

    Ideas for improving documentation

    Bugs in the code or output

    Errors in the documentation

    New tutorials

It is preferable to get in touch through GitHub, at https://github.com/BioKT/AdaptiveMasterMSM. As usual, you have to FORK AdaptiveMasterMSM, make the corresponding modifications in your own FORK, and finally do a PULL REQUEST to the main/official repository of AdaptiveMasterMSM. Remember that you can clone the main AdaptiveMasterMSM repository, but since you have read-only permission, you cannot PUSH to the master branch.

Otherwise, you can contact David de Sancho and/or Ion Mitxelena by e-mail to: daviddesancho@gmail.com and/or ion.mitxelena@ehu.eus, respectively. Or write us to: Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), Manuel de Lardizabal 4, 20018 Donostia, Euskadi, Spain.
